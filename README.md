Description : 

Hurry Traveler, there is space to explore! On behalf of the ISD, we have assigned you to THREE remote planets that seem hospitiable enough for us to begin our settlements and we need you to go and scope it out. That is your misson!Build our bases and move onto the next, be wary of the natives and other possible threats that may prevent our settlement from growing! Over and out!

Controls : 

Drag and drop turrets, buildings and other means of defense onto the play area and see if your defense strategy will be enough to hold the enemies back! Right click to place and confirm your objects and left click to shoot from your main tower! Collect scrap from fallen enemies to create more defenses, repairs or even get special limtied weapons special to that world. Be careful not to spend it all in one go though, you'll have mulitple waves you must survive in order to clear the planet and deem it settled. For any other questions just click "C" to view our control guide. Good Luck, and have fun exploring!
