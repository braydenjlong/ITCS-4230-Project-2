Description : 

Hurry Traveler, there is space to explore! On behalf of the ISD, we have assigned you to THREE remote planets that seem hospitiable enough for us to begin our settlements and we need you to go and scope it out. That is your misson!Build our bases and move onto the next, be wary of the natives and other possible threats that may prevent our settlement from growing! Over and out!

Controls : 

Drag and drop turrets, buildings and other means of defense onto the play area and see if your defense strategy will be enough to hold the enemies back! Left click to place your towers! Collect Tokens from fallen enemies to create more defenses to protect your main tower, Good luck Traveler!
